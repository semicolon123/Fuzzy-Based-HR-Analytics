# ML_based_HR-Analytics
A predictive model to identify the factors that influence an employee to leave an organization.

The aim is to do the analysis of the factors which are responsible due to which some students
who got placed are not joining an organization and to predict whether a certain student will join
the organization using fuzzy logic. We got the data set of about 175 students from our college.
The dataset is used to do inferential and predictive analysis. Inferential analysis helps in finding
the attribute values of those students who got an offer and are also willing to join. Using those
values, fuzzy rules are created and using those fuzzy rules, prediction for new student are made,
if he/she will join the company or not.
Any company expects that the student, to whom it is offering a job opportunity, is definitely
going to join. Fuzzy rule based logic helps us find the probability of a student joining the
organisation, if offered a job.
